# MySQL Python Chatbot with GPT-4 and Mistral AI

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our tutorial on building a natural language SQL chatbot using GPT-4! In this project, we will guide you through creating a chatbot capable of interpreting and responding to user queries in natural language, generating SQL queries dynamically, and retrieving results from a MySQL database. The project features a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users of all skill levels to engage effortlessly.

## How It Works
Our chatbot takes a user's natural language query, translates it into a SQL query utilizing GPT-4, performs the query against a MySQL database, and returns the result back to the user in natural language format. Various stages of data handling and interactions with both OpenAI API and MySQL database occur smoothly within a Streamlit application.
